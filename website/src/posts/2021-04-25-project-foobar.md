It is time.

Late last year we were chatting with some folks from Weever on how we might be able to team up on events and other TND activities, and I think it was [Jenifer Champagne](https://thenewdevelopers.com/s03e02-introduction-to-rust-feat-jenifer-champagne/) who suggested organizing a long-running project that would help give students some hands-on experience. It was an ambitious idea, and one that filled us with fear and questions - what would this project be? What if students weren't interested? How could we possibly pull this off?

We spent a long time mulling it over, and decided that the best way to answer some of those questions was to make finding their solution part of the project itself. The students who will be helping to build this project should be the same ones to decide _what_ they will be building. Our role will be as project managers: we'll bring the plan and all of the support, pulling in from our network of professionals to help lend their skills and experience when needed. 

So, here's the plan: over the next four months, we will build and deploy an application that has _real_ users, and which will hopefully improve the lives of those people in some capacity. Here at TND we've always been motivated at our core to help students get jobs; this project will not only give you an excellent addition to your portfolio, but you'll have a chance to be involved in the software development life cycle from idea conception all the way through to execution, learning and applying industry best-practices the whole way.

The part I'm most excited about is that we'll be giving students an opportunity to pair up with professional developers and devops specialists in coding and deployment. This means you won't need to be an expert in whatever tech stack ends up being chosen;
