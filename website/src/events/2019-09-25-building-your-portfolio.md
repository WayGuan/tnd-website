The fall semester is finally underway, and we know you're all eager to get fingers on keyboards. We are too, which is why our first fall workshop is totally hands-on. Source control is an integral part of working on collaborative code projects, but it isn't taught in a formal way in the college's curriculum.

[Dat Nguyen](https://twitter.com/itsdatnguyen), a recent Mohawk grad and creator of [CSS Playground](https://css-playground.com/), is going to teach you how to rack up side projects--without having to start from scratch--by contributing to open source repositories using GitHub. By the end of this interactive event, you'll be able to fork a repository, make and push commits, create pull requests, and understand what all of those terms actually mean. It's not as scary as it sounds, we promise. If you already know git, great! Come anyway, impress your friends, beguile your enemies, get another green box on your contribution heat map.

Please register for this event if you're planning to attend! Though the event is free and we don't take attendance, registration helps us plan for refreshments and shows our benefactors that this content is valuable to students.

Once you're registered, we'll send you a quick rundown on some prep material if you'd like to get ahead of the curve and information on what you'll need to bring with you to the workshop (spoilers: most of it is just your winning personality).

Don't forget to [join our mailing list](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/XNR88XG) to get first word on all of our events and activities.

We look forward to seeing you there!
