We've picked [the idea we want to build](https://thenewdevelopers.com/2021-05-10-project-foobar-idea-kids-can-code/), and now we need to describe exactly what this application needs to _do._ 

To get help on this, we'll be bringing in [Weever ](https://weeverapps.com/)co-founder Andrew Holden to introduce to us what requirements are, how to go about defining them, and he'll also walk us through defining some of the requirements for our project. 

We'll also be bringing in the illustrious Kevin Browne, former Mohawk instructor and current McMaster professor, to help Andrew define some of those requirements, as it was Kevin who first pitched us this idea.

We'll be meeting up in the #Foobar-Voice channel in our Discord server on Thursday, May 20 at 5:00pm. 

See you there!
