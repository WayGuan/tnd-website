The Winter 2021 semester is coming to an end and what better way to close it off than with a party?

Join us at our virtual CSAIT Social for some well-deserved time off. Meet new people, make friends, and just have a good time with fellow CSAIT students and Industry Professionals working in Hamilton!\
\
The social will be hosted on Discord and will feature different rooms to enjoy different conversations.

Share a Project you're working on, or interested in, at our **Projects Room**!\
Talk about and enjoy music with fellow music heads at our **Music Room**!\
Play or discuss games with fellow gamers at our **Games Room**!

You do not need to prepare anything for the event! Throw on your comfiest clothes and take it easy.\
There is no ticket, requirement, or registration. Simply hop into the Discord, and a have a great time! :D
