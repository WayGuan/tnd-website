For our October workshop we’re putting on a speed interviewing event where we’ll have several hiring managers from local companies run 5-minute mock interviews with attendees, and where you'll be able to sign up for multiple interviews. It’ll be a low-stakes environment perfect for practicing your interviewing skills, though there’s always the chance that a particularly impressive performance could lead to more promising opportunities.

**NOTE**: Because of the limited time and number of interviewers, we can currently only make 20 spots available - if you show up without having registered we can put you on a stand-by list and you’ll be able to listen in on the feedback from the interviewers at the end of the night, but we cannot guarantee participation. 

So _please make sure to register as soon as possible if you are interested in this event_.

Here is the current list of interviewers:

* [**Chad Ingles**](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/chadingles) - COO and CTO of [Fotaflo](https://www.fotaflo.com/)
