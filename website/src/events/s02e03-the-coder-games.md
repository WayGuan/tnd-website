With [the school closing in response to the pandemic](https://www.mohawkcollege.ca/covid-19-coronavirus/update-on-covid-19-coronavirus), we will also be cancelling the rest of our planned activities for the semester. We'll be coming back with our regular schedule of workshops and social events in September, so keep an eye out on our website or the CSAIT Discord server (email us at `newdevelopers@mohawkcollege.ca` if you'd like an invite).
