Here’s your chance to skill up in one of the more challenging areas of the job hunt: the technical interview. 

For this workshop we’ll be putting everyone into teams of lower and upper semester students to solve coding puzzles in a bit of friendly competition. You’ll get to flex your problem-solving muscles and also get used to collaborative programming!

We’ll have puzzles for developers of all skill levels, from semester one and up. Bring your friends and classmates or join a merry band of coding mercenaries to fight for honour and glory! Try to solve a pile of smaller puzzles or go for big points with logic problems used in Google and Shopify interviews!

All teams who hit the point target will be featured in a blog post on our website, and the team with the highest score will have their solution published for fame and fortune (and a sweet, shiny gold star for their resume).

Free pizza and refreshments will be available for all registrants.

Good luck, and may the compiler be ever in your favour.
