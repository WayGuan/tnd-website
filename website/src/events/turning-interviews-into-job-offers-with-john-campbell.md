It's interview season once again. Whether you're up for that co-op dream job or you're sending out your resume while you hammer out your capstone, it's good to get on top of your interview game. TND has your back with the first of two events this month focused on how to turn interviews into job offers.

Our speaker, John Campbell, is a Managing Director at [Ian Martin Group](https://ianmartin.com/), an IT staffing company with offices throughout Canada and the United States. John is also a member of the advisory board for the Software Development program, helping Mohawk College keep our curriculum current and valuable. He is coming the week after the co-op prep class wraps up to talk to you about what employers want, how to tailor your resume, how to prep and how to keep people engaged in what you have to say.

John's clients in his day job are often employers themselves. He spends a lot of time teaching those employers how to conduct interviews with people like you. He can talk about this process from both perspectives!

Get answers to your burning questions baked right in to the presentation by [answering our survey on your own interview strengths and stressors](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/8LGMQBZ). John plans to tailor his talk based on your responses and we just can't get enough of them.

There's no registration for this event, but we'll be making regular blog posts throughout the semester with more discussion on topics like this, so get on our website and check those out as you're heading in for that next interview. While you're there, you can [sign up for our mailing list](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/XNR88XG) and register for our next workshop: [Mastering the Interview](https://thenewdevelopers.com/s01e03-mastering-the-interview/).
