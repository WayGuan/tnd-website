Join us June 4th, 2021 @ 7PM on The New Developers discord server as Jenifer Champagne guides us through the different options to deploy Project FOOBAR! Maybe you are an Azure die hard, or maybe Microsoft is more your speed. Either way, come and learn some of the pros and cons of different deployment options. This will help us with Project FOOBAR but will also translate to future projects YOU might create. 

**Who is this event for?**
You say you have no experience deploying an application? Great, bring your questions! Are you a deployment aficionado? Great, bring your knowledge and help your fellow students learn a thing or two. Everyone is welcome as we learn and share our knowledge together!
