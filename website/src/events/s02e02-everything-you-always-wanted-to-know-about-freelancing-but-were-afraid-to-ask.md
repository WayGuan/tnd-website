Our next workshop will help get you started in freelancing as a developer. We'll be bringing in Jenifer Champagne, who has been a freelance developer for most of her life, ranging from setting up new websites to consulting on and designing entire new database structures or prototyping internet of things devices. Jenifer's a lifelong technology enthusiast who loves to solve new and interesting problems while making a living in doing so independently, and she'll be spending an hour with us to talk about how to find your first clients, how much you should charge, and answer any other burning questions you might have.

We'll also be doing something a little different with this workshop: we'll be livestreaming this on our YouTube channel, so you can enjoy the discussion from the comfort of your bedroom or the pub (or wherever you happen to be). You'll be able to submit questions in the live chat for Jenifer to answer, and the video will be posted for you to view at any later date.

Head to this link at 7:00pm on Wednesday, March 4 to join in, or click now to set up a reminder when we go live: [https://youtu.be/oIA-Hi2KR88](https://youtu.be/oIA-Hi2KR88)
