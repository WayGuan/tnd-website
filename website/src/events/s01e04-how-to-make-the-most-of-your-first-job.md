This will be a quick, 50-minute session where students heading in to their first co-op can find answers to all of their burning questions: How do I maximize my learning during the co-op? What are my mentors expecting from me? Why don't Macs have a proper 'delete' button? 

To help answer those questions, we're bringing in 5 seasoned veterans:

[**Jeff McIsaac**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-mcisaac-b16a58b4/) - Dean of Applied Research at Mohawk College, who previously oversaw hiring co-ops with AMIC at IDEAWORKS on campus, and will give us an employer's perspective. 

[**Sierra Robinson**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sierrarobinson-3d/) - One of Jeff's star students, who graduated recently and is now working as a 3D Application Specialist at Applied Precision 3D.

[**Jeremy Burgstaler**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-burgstaler-849629a3/) - A 4th-semester software student who's currently working part-time at MEDIC and completed his co-op this year as a Java developer with Procor Limited.

[**Ceagan Paladino**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceagan-paladino-990b3318a/) - A 4th-semester software student  who worked in Software Quality Assurance at Timberland Equipment during his co-op earlier this year.

[**Emily Stanek**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilymstanek/) - A 4th-semester software student who completed her co-op this year at Bursting Silver and has continued working with them part-time throughout this semester.
