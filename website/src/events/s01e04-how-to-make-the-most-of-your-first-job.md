This will be a quick, 50-minute session where students heading in to their first co-op can find answers to all of their burning questions: How do I maximize my learning during the co-op? What are my mentors expecting from me? Why don't Macs have a proper 'delete' button? 

To help answer those questions, we're bringing in 5 seasoned veterans:

**Jeff McIsaac** - Dean of Applied Research at Mohawk College, who previously oversaw hiring co-ops with AMIC at IDEAWORKS on campus, and will give us an employer's perspective. 

**Sierra Robinson** - One of Jeff's star students, who graduated recently and is now working as a 3D Application Specialist at Applid Precision 3D.

**Jeremy Burgstaler** - A 4th-semester software student who's currently working part-time at MEDIC and completed his co-op this year as a Java developer with Procor Limited.

**Ceagan Paladino** - ???

**Emily Stanek** - A 4th-semester software student who completed her co-op this year at Bursting Silver and has continued working with them part-time throughout this semester.
