This will be a live-coding stream with returning guest [Rodney Barnes](https://github.com/rodneybarnes). Rodney is a recent CSAIT grad, co-founder of The New Developers, and current junior dev at Reliq Health. He'll walk us through creating an 'Opportunities' page for The New Developers website that will leverage the Software Hamilton API to display industry job postings that students might be interested in. Learn about how the website is built, how to make your own contributions to open source projects like ours, and take advantage of the final product too!

While the website is built with Gatsby and React, you should be able to follow along if you're familiar with Javascript.

[This blog post](https://thenewdevelopers.com/2020-10-13-how-to-make-your-first-open-source-contribution/) offers some links to get you started with Gatsby and React.
