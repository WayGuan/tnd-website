This will be a live-coding stream where [Rodney Barnes](https://github.com/rodneybarnes) - recent CSAIT grad, currently junior developer at Reliq Health, and a co-founder of The New Developers - will walk through creating an 'Opportunities' page for The New Developers website.

While the website is built with Gatsby and React, you should be able to follow along if you're familiar with Javascript.

[This blog post](https://thenewdevelopers.com/2020-10-13-how-to-make-your-first-open-source-contribution/) offers some links to get you started with Gatsby and React.
