**UPDATE:** This event will NOT be running at the originally scheduled date/time; we will be rescheduling this soon, and will update this post as soon as we can.



Requirements? GATHERED! ðŸ˜Ž Now we need to decide the tool to translate them into our design ðŸ“² . So, it comes down to the questions that many of us were wondering, what languages will we be using to write code?  How can I contribute to the project with the limited programming languages I have learned? ðŸ¤” 

Jenifer Champagne from [Weever](https://weeverapps.com/) will direct us in choosing the most suitable programming languages for our project. Come and check out how programming languages for a project are considered, how you can still apply the languages you have learned thus far to the project (even if you aren't completely familiar with the languages that are chosen), and how to decide what languages are appropriate for the problem you are trying to solve . 

COME ON DOWN to the #Foobar-Voice channel in our Discord server on Friday, May 28 at 7:00pm.
See you there! ðŸ¤© ðŸ”¥
