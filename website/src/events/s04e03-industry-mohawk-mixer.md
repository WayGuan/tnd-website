Join us this coming Friday, at 7pm for our first Industry-Mohawk Mixer!\
\
In this pandemic, making connections with others in the Computer Science community is harder than ever. At our virtual, business-casual, event you'll meet experienced industry pros from exciting companies right here in Hamilton: Weever Apps, Ackroo Inc., and Reliq Health to name a few.\
\
Making connections with fellow classmates and colleagues has also not been easy lately! So, take this opportunity to finally get to meet that one JohnDoe123 that's always cracking jokes in your Zoom class. Perhaps even cooler, reach out to a Mohawk Alumni and ask them about their experiences at Mohawk and their life in the field.

The event will be hosted in The New Developers Discord server where we will open many different channels for conversation. You'll be able to video chat, share your screen, and voice chat all at the same time.\
\
Hope to see you there!
