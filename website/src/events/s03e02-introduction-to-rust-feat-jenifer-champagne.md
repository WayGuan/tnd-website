Join The New Developers for an introduction to the Rust programming language, delivered by our returning guest Jenifer Champagne of [Weever Apps](https://weeverapps.com/). She’ll be covering the basics of Rust with a coding tutorial, followed by a live online Q&A session.\
You can watch the event live on our [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/thenewdevelopers) and ask your questions in the chat!\
\
Jenifer has worked in the industry for many years and is heavily involved in the Hamilton developer community. Take advantage of this opportunity to ask her questions you may have about the Rust language or anything at all about software development.\
\
***"But I don't know anything about Rust!"***\
Did we mention it's just an introduction? Jenifer's talk has been designed to introduce Rust from the ground up. She is an extraordinary teacher.\
\
***“But the Rust language isn’t even part of the Mohawk software program. Do I need it?”***\
It’s true that you don’t need to know Rust for your courses at Mohawk. But on top of just being interesting, learning any new programming language will help reinforce your understanding of the programming fundamentals that all languages share. Also, Jenifer is a very accomplished programmer, so no matter what language she’s teaching us, we’re going to learn more than just the language itself.\
\
***"But I don't really know anything about programming yet!"*** Then you *really* should come. Our events aim to inspire new developers to learn and enhance the skills needed to succeed in the field. Attending an event like this just might motivate you to dive deeper into programming and learn about more languages. But don’t worry – nobody will ask you to code anything at the event! Ask Jenifer some questions only if you want to. Otherwise, just enjoy the tutorial!\
\
Hope to see you there!\
